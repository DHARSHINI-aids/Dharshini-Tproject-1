        "*   **Summarize the functionality of the text-based calculator:**\n",
        "    The `text_calculator` function is a simple, command-line interface calculator that prompts the user for two numbers and an arithmetic operation (+, -, \\*, /). It performs the requested calculation and returns the result. It includes robust error handling for invalid number inputs, division by zero, and unsupported operations.\n",
        "*   **Is the text-based calculator suitable for the Colab environment?**\n",
        "    Yes, the text-based calculator is suitable for the Colab environment. It's a standard Python function that interacts with the user via `input()` and `print()`, which are fully supported in Colab notebooks. Its self-contained nature and demonstration within the notebook confirm its operational readiness in this environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A `text_calculator()` Python function was successfully defined, capable of taking two numeric inputs and an arithmetic operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).\n",
        "*   The function incorporates error handling for common issues, such as `ValueError` for non-numeric input, prevention of division by zero, and invalid operation selection.\n",
        "*   The demonstration of the `text_calculator()` function successfully executed a calculation and returned a result (e.g., `156.0`), confirming its intended functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The current calculator is foundational; future enhancements could include support for more complex operations (e.g., exponents, roots), scientific functions, or multi-operation expressions.\n",
        "*   To improve user experience in an interactive environment like Colab, consider integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) or a more sophisticated input parsing mechanism to handle expressions directly rather than single operations.\n"
